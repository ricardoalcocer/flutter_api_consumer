# CONSUME API

Experiments in consuming API data in Flutter

## Branches

* `main` - A simple App with a button
* `loads_from_api` - A simple App that has a welcome page with a button, and upon click, data gets loaded from an API endpoint
* `api_parent_child` - A complete example of an app that loads data upon launch, shows it in a listview, and clicking rows take you to a child page with data for the row.
